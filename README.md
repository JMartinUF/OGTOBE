# Wedding Website Prototype

This app is a prototype of a wedding website I'm building for my fianc√©e. The project serves as a day-by-day progress tracker as well as a personal showcase of web development skills.

## How to Run the App

To start the development server, use the following command:

'npm run dev'

## Day 1:

What I did:

- Created a header that has a dynamic countdown for how many days until our wedding day.
- Created the nav bar with links to various pages.
- Created the main page.jsx that renders everything.
- First push.

## Day 2:

What I did:

- Created a Nhost Project that processes the database:
  https://app.nhost.io/orgs/riotfqaddspjmuogrshl/projects/ttkyyarywykcfihkntdm/database/browser/default
- Starting the Process of holding data for the RSVP and maybe going to talk about the Registry later today.
- Got the RSVP table built so that I can register a user and have them add a email and guest. This command removes the data and starts the IDs back to one.:

  TRUNCATE TABLE rsvp RESTART IDENTITY;
  (run this in the sql editor on nhost)
