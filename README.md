# Wedding Website Prototype

This app is a prototype of a wedding website I'm building for my fianc√©e. The project serves as a day-by-day progress tracker as well as a personal showcase of web development skills.

## How to Run the App
To start the development server, use the following command:

'npm run dev'

## Day 1:
What I did:
 - Created a header that has a dynamic countdown for how many days until our wedding day. 
 - Created the nav bar with links to various pages.
 - Created the main page.jsx that renders everything.
 - First push.
